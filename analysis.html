<h3 id="Why-am-I-doing-this-project?">Why am I doing this project?<a class="anchor-link" href="#Why-am-I-doing-this-project?">&#182;</a></h3><p>Inspired by <a href="https://github.com/AYLIEN/headline_analysis/blob/master/main-chunks.ipynb" title="AYLIEN&#39;s News Headline Analysis">this project</a>, I will largely emulate the analysis that was done but on a different data set from a more unique and up-to-date source – <strong>GDELT</strong>, or more specifically, the <a href="https://blog.gdeltproject.org/gdelt-2-0-our-global-world-in-realtime/" title="GDELT 2.0: Our Global World in Realtime"><strong>GDELT 2.0: Our Global World in Realtime</strong></a>.</p>
<p>My main goal for this personal project is to learn, practice, and explore <code>Python</code> scripting as I'm career switching and coding is fairly new to me. Secondly, as an introduction via <em>parse trees</em> (see below), I aim to further explore the
<a href="http://www.nltk.org/" title="NLTK"><strong>Natural Language Toolkit</strong></a> or <strong>NLTK</strong> and how it is used in sentiment analysis. Lastly, I'm familiarising and leveraging on the GDELT database because I think it will be a good source of data for any future projects.</p>
<p>Other 'side-quests' are to explore integration with <code>SQLite</code> databases, practising SQL,</p>
<h3 id="What-is-this-project-about?">What is this project about?<a class="anchor-link" href="#What-is-this-project-about?">&#182;</a></h3><p>As per the project by AYLIEN referenced above, instead of authors, I'm looking into the similarities and differences between the ways headlines for news articles are written on two websites (among many in the GDELT data). Namely:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>website1</code> = chinadaily.com.cn; and</li>
<li><code>website2</code> = bbc.co.uk</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Where-is-the-data-from?">Where is the data from?<a class="anchor-link" href="#Where-is-the-data-from?">&#182;</a></h3><p>In this project, I am using a sample size of 1000 random headlines for each website. The headlines are HTML parsed from URL links in the <a href="http://data.gdeltproject.org/gdeltv2/masterfilelist.txt" title="GDELT 2.0: Our Global World in Realtime">"Master CSV Data File List – English"</a> from GDELT. Python and SQL were used to scrape and organise the data which is now Pickled and ready for analysis using python.</p>
<p>The pickled files are easily found in the GitHub directory of this project. One can also run the other python scripts listed in the table below to download the entire database and work from there (e.g. to analyse other websites), but I suggest running the scripts locally as it will take up a lot of space.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-get-started-(on-local-PC)?">How to get started (on local PC)?<a class="anchor-link" href="#How-to-get-started-(on-local-PC)?">&#182;</a></h3><p>Essentially, just running this jupyter notebook would suffice for the analysis as the dataset needed has been filtered and saved in the same directory.</p>
<p>But initially, I wrote 4 separate python scripts that have individual functions for downloading, processing, and extracting the GDELT data. The bulk of my learning (and time) came from scripting these 4 files to automate the data retrieval and wrangling.</p>
<p>I suggest to <strong><em>only run on a local computer</em></strong> files 1, 2, and 4 as the database it will download may be huge. On the other hand, the jupyter notebook (file 5) can be safely run online as it is using a filtered dataset.</p>

<p>For a simple sentence like "The cat sat on the mat", a parse tree might look like this:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>In this project, we are using the <a href="https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/pages/pattern-en#tree" title="Patterns Library">Pattern library</a> for Python to parse the headlines and create parse trees for each of them.</p>
<p>However, in future projects, I aim to use and explore NLTK instead of Patterns library because (1) it is more up to date and has more extensive features, and (2) I ran into a couple of issues while using the Patterns library in Python3.</p>
<p>Below, we load the Patterns library and see it in action using a test sentence:</p>

<p>In our main analysis, for the main indicator of the overall structure of a headline, we will use the first level of the parse tree (i.e. the chunk type sequence) of each headline.</p>
<p>So using the above example, we will be using the following sequence of chunk type:</p>

<pre><code>['NP', 'NP', 'VP', 'PP', 'NP', 'NP', 'NP']</code></pre>

<h3 id="Similarity-metric">Similarity metric<a class="anchor-link" href="#Similarity-metric">&#182;</a></h3><p>Now that we have prepared the data for our first website, we need a way to tell how different or similar are two headlines. (e.g. how different or similar is A, B, C to A, B, D)</p>
<p>To do that, we have to look at it from a structural perspective (hence using the chuck type sequence) and employ the help of a similarity metric.</p>
<p>We use the <code>SequenceMatcher</code> class of <code>difflib</code> for this, which produces a similarity score between 0 and 1 for any two sequences (Python lists), as per the example below:</p>

<p>Above is an interactive chart that shows a few groupings of headlines as well as some sparse ones.</p>
<p>Some dense group of headlines that stands out are:</p>
<ol>
<li>NP, PP, NP group on the top left has short and to the point updates like "Monopoly law under revision";</li>
<li>NP, VP, NP group on the far right has headlines that indicate an action about to occur, in the "China to..." format; and</li>
<li>NP, VP, NP, PP, NP group at the bottom has headlines that are similar to group 2 above but with more context/details, for example: "SF sues Trump over sanctuary city executive order" or "Xinjiang imports 21 prized horses from Kazakhstan".</li>

<p>One can find other interesting groups using the 'box zoom' feature, as well as note the similarities to other points in proximity.</p>

<p>The chart above allows us to view, in the same way, the groups of headlines style which both websites shares or are unique to each.</p>
<p>Some observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>We can see the top portion of the chart has small clusters of Green points which suggest website2 (bbc.co.uk) has its unique but consistent style of headlines with forms like "Mexico prison riot: UN calls for investigation".</li>
<li>But website1 (chinadaily.com.cn) has most of its Orange points in the major/bigger clusters in the top-, bottom-, left-, and bottom-right most portion of the chart. </li>
<li>Visually the chart reaffirms the finding in "Common headlines" above, which showed that 77.7% of the headlines were similar!</li>
<li>Unfortunately, as compared to the original AYLIEN project which analysis produced a chart that could visually distinguish the topic or themes of the authors' headlines in different clusters, my chart only separates them by the chunk patterns. For example, the leftmost cluster and the rightmost cluster may have different chunk patterns (longer vs. shorter), but both may be talking about the same topic such as the economy or Donald Trump. </li>
</ul>
<p>Despite the drawback stated in the last point, a closer examination could yield new observations or could spark further points for investigation.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-and-Future-Work">Conclusion and Future Work<a class="anchor-link" href="#Conclusion-and-Future-Work">&#182;</a></h2><hr>
<p>From this project I have felt my python scripting has improved as I was able to automate retrieval of data (headlines) from multiple links, build an <code>SQLite</code> database to store and organise the large datasets, performed data wrangling and parsing using the <code>pandas</code> and <code>patterns</code> library, evaluate headline structures and similarities, and finally plotting the data points on a clear and interactive visual map using <code>Bokeh</code>.</p>
<p>For future projects, I may wish to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Perform the analysis on other websites in the database (e.g. "indiatimes.com", "mainichi.jp", etc.)</li>
<li>Address the weakness of this approach as stated in the original project, i.e.:<ol>
<li>Using entire parse trees instead of just chunks; </li>
<li>Using a tree or graph similarity metric instead of a sequence similarity one (ideally a linguistic-aware one too); and</li>
<li>Better pre-processing to identify and normalize Named Entities, etc.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Employ the use of <code>NLTK</code> instead of <code>pattern</code> library as it has more features and could address the 2.C. issue above. </li>
</ol>
